#' alicetwist package - Implementation of the 'Alice Twist' game
#'
#' Alice Twist is a game between 2 or more opponents which have
#' two or more hands with 3 or more fingers. The goal of the game
#' is to make the other opponents with zero fingers left by forcing
#' them to reach the maximum number of fingers in a hand. When a
#' hand with n fingers hits another hand with m fingers, the hand
#' with m fingers will end with n+m fingers modulus the maximum
#' number of fingers in a hand.
